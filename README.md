# EmoGZ
A simple, esoteric, Emoji Based language.  EmoGZ (pronounced Emojis) was not made for practical use, but rather as an experiment to test limits of language design.

EmoGZ is written in pure C and uses no external libraries.  It is interpreted and designed to be relatively memory efficient.  It is designed to be distributed in source form as a compressed binary.
